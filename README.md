## pymaceuticals Description
This repository contains a SQL project for data modelling and analysis. Within the EmployeeSQL folder, there are csv files containing the data of workers employed to work in a comapny between the 1980s and 1990s. There are also csv files that begin with the term "modified". These are the same csv files as the the (dept_emp, dept_manager, employees, departments,salaries). However, the date in these csv files were modified to YYYY-MM-DD using pandas to support its import into postgresql, since postgresql is set to YYY-MMM-DD by default. AS well, the headers were removed too when saving the file through pandas to support import into postgreSQL.

The repository contains the ERD for the data modelling ("ERD_sql_challenge") as well as the sql schemata used for creating the tables ("sql_challenge_schemata") and the sql queries for data analytics.
